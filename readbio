I am a student of Automation, Robotics and Industrial Control at Cinel Lisboa.
I ðŸ‘€ am always interested in learning new things and being happy. I want to learn more about programming, robotics and English,
and you're always welcome to talk to me about it.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning programming, robotics and industrial control and still studying about English, but the focus is to learn about programming, robotics,
in general to learn a lot about Robotic Automation...

ðŸ”­ The world is focused on improving various technologies and robotics is one of them. this sector will undoubtedly still grow a lot,
I want to be able to face all the challenges that come before me.

ðŸ“« How to get to me I do not know maybe by social networks, you will find the link at the end of this biography..  ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ“„I started to like computers at a young age, but I started in the area of programming and robotic automation not long ago,
but with the spirit of learning everything that is necessary to follow in the area that I like and will work in the future.
my projects are still private (some public), but in the future I will make them available.
